There are quite a lot of settings that are not in the "Settings" tab.
Some of them are in testing or made for debugging and not saved due the possible instability.

You can scroll through the entire list of all possible settings by writing
```
cfg_set \
# "\" means ALL in auto completion
# It is ignored when executing the command, used just for convenience
```

Also you can easily change settings by their name
```
cfg_set crosshair_length 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
